        <p style="text-align:center;">Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates
             the importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and
              building wealth through investing in assets, real estate investing, starting and owning
               businesses, as well as increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ).</p>

           <p> Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables, ostensibly 
            based on Kiyosaki's life.[1] The titular "rich dad" is his friend's father who accumulated
             wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the "poor dad" is claimed to be
              Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security.
            
            The existence of Kiyosaki's "Rich Dad" remains unproven, and there is no documentation on
             Kiyosaki's alleged vast reserves of wealth earned before Rich Dad Poor Dad was published.</p>

             <p>No One Would Listen: A True Financial Thriller is a book by whistleblower
                 Harry Markopolos about his investigation into the Madoff investment scandal
                  and how the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission failed to react to his warnings.
                   The book was released on March 2, 2010, by John Wiley & Sons.
                Markopolos was a guest on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart on March 8, 2010.</p>

                <img align="right" src="./rdpd3.jpg" height="10%" width="10%">
                <p>The New York Journal of Books felt that the book provided 
                    "a really insightful look into the world of high finance, and the 
                    best explanation of the Madoff fraud", but found that it had "too much ...
                about Markopolos himself, his family, his friends".[2] Publishers Weekly
                called it "an astonishing true-life whodunit", with the repercussions of
                Madoff's downfall serving as "a satisfying conclusion";[3] LexisNexis,
                however, faulted Markopolos for being overly critical of the SEC,[4] and 
                 at the Wall Street Journal, Richard Tofel (while conceding the quality of 
                 Markopolos's investigative work) stated that—by describing his own fears of 
                 retribution from organized crime—Markopolos
                "sheds more light than he intends on just why no one would listen"</p>
                <img align="left" src="./rdpd 5.jpg" height="10%" width="10%">
                <p>When Harry Markopolos began his career in the securities industry, 
                    he applied his mathematical skills to the design of investment products. 
                    In particular, his bosses wanted him to create investment instruments that 
                    competed with those offered by financier Bernie Madoff. When Markopolos 
                    found that Madoff’s results were impossible to match, he suspected that 
                    Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme- not investing money, but paying each
                     investor with cash from other investors. His suspicion led to an investigative odyssey.
                      Markopolos and his team uncovered not only the largest financial fraud in history,
                       but also a dangerously dysfunctional U.S. regulatory system. In this book, Markopolos
                        recounts his frustrating, thwarted efforts to warn the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) 
                    about the threat Madoff posed to unwary investors. </p>
                    <p>failed to respond to his detailed written evidence, though Markopolos submitted
                         it five times, starting in 2000, long before Madoff finally confessed in 2008 
                         (he is now serving 150 years in jail). getAbstract recommends this engrossing 
                         book to readers who
                         want to learn more about this epic scandal and its implications for 
                         financial industry regulation.</p>
