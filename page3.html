    <h2>APJ Abdul Kalam's autobiography, Wings of Fire, covers his early life as
         well as his role in Indian space research and missile programmes. It tells 
         the narrative of a young boy from a poor family who rose through the ranks 
         of Indian space research and
         missile programmes to become the country's president.</h2>

    <p>In the autobiography, Kalam examines his early life, effort,
         hardship, fortitude, luck and chance that eventually led 
         him to lead Indian space research, nuclear and missile programs.
          Kalam started his career, after graduating from Aerospace engineering
           at Madras Institute of Technology, at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited 
           and was assigned to build a hovercraft prototype. Later he moved to
            ISRO and helped establish the Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre and pioneered
             the first space launch-vehicle program. During the 1990s and early 2000, 
             Kalam moved to the DRDO to lead the Indian nuclear weapons program, with 
             particular successes in thermonuclear weapons development culminating in
         the operation Smiling Buddha and an ICBM Agni.</p>
         
         <p>Kalam was born on October 15, 1931, the son of a little educated boat owner
            in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. His father was also imam of the small mosque in 
            Rameswaram. He had an unparalleled career as a defence scientist, culminating 
            in the highest civilian award of India, Bharat Ratna. As chief of the country's
             defence research and development programmer, Kalam demonstrated a great, great 
             potential for dynamics and innovations that existed in a seemingly moribund 
             research establishment. This is the story of Kalam's own rise from obscurity
              and his personal and professional struggles, as well as the story of AGNI, 
              TRISHUL, and NAG missiles that have become household names in India and that 
              have raised the nation to the level of a missile power of international reckoning. 
              Since independence, India has sought in various ways, self-realization, adulation,
               and success.</p>

                     <p>“Wings of Fire” is an account of a young boy who tries to achieve 
                        his dreams beating all odds. The story emphasizes the importance of family, 
                        relatives and friends in helping

                        <h2>Moral:Expert-Verified Answer. Written by APJ Abdul Kalam, the last
                             segment of the 'Wings of Fire' is connected with the later years when
                              Kalam is bestowed upon with series of awards, his thought and his vision for a proud India.
                             It is almost impossible not to be inspired by the life of Mr. Kalam.</h2>
