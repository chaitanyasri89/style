    <h2>“Take up one idea. Make that one idea your life; dream of it; 
        think of it; live on that idea. Let the brain, the body, muscles, nerves, 
        every part of your body be full of that idea, and just leave every other idea alone.
         This is the way to success, and this is the way great spiritual giants are produced.”</h2>
         <img align="left" src="./swami 3.jpg" height="200" width="200">
         <p>Advance like a hero. Don’t be thwarted by anything. How many days will this 
            body last, with its happiness and misery? When you have got the human body, then
             rouse the Atman within and say — i have reached the state of fearlessness!
              Say — i am the Atman in which my lower ego has become merged for ever.
               Be perfect in this idea; and then as long as the body endures, speak unto others
                this message of fearlessness: “Thou art That”, “Arise, awake, and stop not till 
                the goal is reached!” 
            If you can achieve this, then shall I know that you are really a tenacious East Bengal man</p>
            <h2>“Take up an idea, devote yourself, struggle in patience, and the sun will rise.”</h2>
               <p> When you think of doing something, decide that you are going to work toward 
                it with all you have. Immerse yourself and get through the tough times with
                 patience, because good things do not come easy.
                 Be honest in your efforts and believe that the sun will shine on you.</p>
                 <h2>“Arise, awake, and don’t stop till you reach your goal.”<h2>
                   <p> This Swami Vivekananda quote talks about the power of consistency 
                    striving towards your goal. It is easy to go off-road and forget why
                     we started doing something. Reminding yourself about it every day and
                      putting in the work will take effort. However, doing the work and doing it consistently are 
                    the only things that will get you where you want to go.</p>
                    <p>“The moral, in one word, is that you are divine.” 
                        The thought of God dwelling in every being and everything around
                         us is empowering. When you see everything including yourself as divine, 
                         you are filled with love and belief in yourself. Love and belief are the 
                         greatest forces of nature and there’s
                         nothing you cannot achieve with those two in your hands.</p>

                we have an amazing read just for you. Here are 10 Swami Vivekananda quotes that will
                 lift your spirits and remind you of your greatest potential.</h3>
            <img align="left" src="./swami 4.jpg" height="200" width="200">
            <p>Swami Vivekananda was one of the greatest spiritual leaders of India. 
                With his deep insight into spirituality and strong personality,
                 he inspired many of us to look at things differently. Born in 1863 
                 as Narendra Nath Datta, Swami Vivekananda went on to become the
                  disciple of Swami Ramkrishna Paramhansa. Along with being proficient 
                  in music, arts, and literature, he has played an instrumental role in
                   introducing yoga and Vedanta to the western world. We have enlisted 
                   some of the best Swami Vivekananda quotes that are literal
                 gems of wisdom and have impacted minds across the globe.</p>

                 <p>“In a day, when you don’t come across any problems – you can be sure that you are traveling the wrong path”
                    Success and progress do not come easy. If it were so, you would learn nothing and you would not grow at all. The first step towards achieving something is accepting that it will not come easy. You have to face challenges. But in the end, it is all going to be worth it!
                    
                    “We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think. Words are secondary.
                     Thoughts live; they travel far.”
                    What you think defines who you are. We may feel that we don’t have control over our thoughts, 
                    but we actually do. Train your mind and thoughts to serve you. Words can be manipulated and
                     you may not always speak what is on your mind. But your thoughts reflect on your being. 
                     They multiply and reach places, so take care of what you think.</p>

                     “Dare to be free, dare to go as far as your thought leads and dare to carry that out in your life.”
                    If you can think about it, you can certainly do it. Have the courage to bring your dreams to fruition.
                     Go after what you desire because that is the only way to make it your reality.</p>
                    
                    <p> “The great secret of true success, of true happiness is this: the man or woman
                         who asks for no return, the perfectly unselfish person is the most successful.” 
                    True success can only come from selflessness. </p>
